## What works so far?

- Exporting a file to \*.txt
- Editing the dimensions of a currently edited document
- Generic selection of characters and the ability to delete said characters in an editor
- Opening a \*.txt (or other user defined format) file directly into the editor

## What is planned (in order)?

- Change canvas size appropriately when opening a session file of different height and width
- Ability to open a preset \*.txt file for selectable characters
- Optimizations for non-windows systems (on mac / certain DEs, TCL works and displays differently)

## There is an issue when performing (...) on (...) platform that breaks my session!

This project is currently under active development and odd behaviour is expected. I am aware that TCL/tkinter does have differences between Mac OS, Windows, and Linux DEs.

As of now, the projecing is being developed for Windows in mind with better support for non-Windows platforms planned at a future date.
