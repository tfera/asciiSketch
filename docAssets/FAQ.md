## What works so far?

- Exporting a file to \*.txt
- Editing the dimensions of a currently edited document
- Generic selection of characters and the ability to delete said characters in an editor

## What is planned (in order)?

- Ability to open a preset \*.txt file for selectable characters
- Opening a \*.txt file directly to the editor
- Optimizations for non-windows systems (on mac / certains DEs TCL works and displays differently)
